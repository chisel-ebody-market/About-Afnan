        <p>
          I am a student with 3 friends. In my family, I have 2 brothers (excluding
         myself). I am a
          Canadian Muslim whose parents were born in India. So far, school's been really
          difficult since Grade 7, but I try to have a positive attitude despite
          that. I have an interest in computers and almost anything Ontario
          (specifically in Ontario, and mainly transportation). Sometimes I get
          short bursts of small interests that last for 1 month to a year. For
          example, I used to be interested in aviation in Grade 7, or what
          Roblox has been doing back in Grade 6 (it wasn't very good). Speaking
          of Roblox, I have a hobby in playing it, and my username is @rishi2af.
          Other hobbies I have are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Experimenting with OSes</li>
          <li>Talking with others</li>
          <li>Social media</li>
          <li>
            Photography (see my
            <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/q7k4PvrBiT63Gm2U7" target="_blank">public collection!</a>)
          </li>
          <li>Chess</li>
          <li>Working on this website (newly discovered)</li>
          <li>Hiking</li>
          <li>Imagining wild, <i>wild</i> scenarios</li>
          <li>Writing emails to companies about fixing their problems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I spend most of my time doing homework, though this isn't a hobby.
          Please note that I'm really, <i>really</i> slow at homework!

        <b>Fun facts:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>I'm a slight introvert.</li>
          <li>
            I have a bunch of VMs lying around my PC for pretty much no reason.
          </li>
          <li>I take a <i>lot</i> of extracurriculars.</li>
          <li>
            "afozan gotmilk" had a pretty complex origin: afozan is a portmaneau
            of "afnan" and "fozail". gotmilk7x7x was from a funny-sounding Wi-Fi
            network a very long time ago. I didn't remember what the 2nd or 4th
            number was, so I had to guess it.
          </li>
          <li>
            "chisel-ebody-market" also had a complex origin. I once used
            chisel-ebony-stocking.glitch.me to host a bunch of random stuff. And
            I used that for my GitHub username. However, I wanted to make it
            unique, so i renamed "stocking" to "market", and accidentally
            mispelled "ebony".
          </li>
          <li>
            Every few minutes when I work on something, I fall down a rabbit
            hole that popped up out of nowhere.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have a list of abandoned scratch projects. It's so many to count,
            that I can't list them here.
          </li>
          <li>I have a very strange specific phobia since I was 10.</li>
          <li>
            Before middle school, my sole interest ALWAYS jumped around. First,
            I was interested in sound effects, then in logos, then in Windows
            Never Released for a small time, then in GoAnimate, then in logos again,
            then in Google Maps, then in logos again, then in Windows, and <i>finally</i> tech.
            After that, I started my "temporary interests" era.
          </li>
          <li>
            I used to be wayyyyy too smart for my age back in elementary school.
          </li>
          <li>It's very hard for you to ashame me.</li>
          <li>
            Sometimes I yap a lot, getting into others' conversations and
            sometimes I'm sullen.
          </li>
          <li>My oldest memory was from when I was 2.</li>
          <li>
            I used to be an iPad kid. Now I'm less of an iPad kid and am a sane
            person now. üòÖ
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Speaking of an iPad, I still have a 2012-2013 iPad in my home as
              my main iPad, and it's definitely downgraded through the years.
